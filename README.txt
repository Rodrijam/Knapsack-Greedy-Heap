Project created by James Rodriguez and Jason Hubbs

This program compares the efficiencies of solving the knapsack problem with the greedy algorithm versus using heaps.

To run this program:
	1) Compile the program using 'make'
	2) run the executable './knapsack.x' with 1 arguments: 'file#'
	e.g. ./knapsack.x 0
	
Notes:
	- When prompted for # of test files, type the number of test files you plan
		to include in the graph
	- For example, if you have files 00 - 08, type '9'
	- All graph images are saved in the knapsack_graphs folder
	- Test files should be placed in same directory as main.cpp
	- 1b is incomplete, it functionally runs the memory algorithm, but does not implement hash functions.
